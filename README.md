programmers-toolbox
===================

Definitive documentation for offline programmers

Goal
----

There are many situations when you don't have access to internet, so it would be convenient to have an offline tool to look up for programming language reference, libraries, examples, frameworks, ddbb...

Features
--------

* Modular. It can contain only one language or multiple
* Lot of doc. By each language you can see
** Language reference
** Core libraries
** Examples for everything
** Tips and tricks
** Getting started guide
* Meta links between languages. You can see equivalences between them (e.g. loop, if...)
* Simple and advanced search. 
* Quickcopy. Any example, or code chunk, can be copied to clipboard with one click.
